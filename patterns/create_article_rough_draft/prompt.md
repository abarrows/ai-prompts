Use the source pool I’ve confirmed to generate a rough draft article.

Tone should match my writing style (conversational, experienced, direct). Make the hook emotionally resonant and draw from real developer moments (debugging, CI, surprises in production, etc.).

You must use the body content from the training data **verbatim only if it meets polish expectations**. Otherwise, reword or restructure the content so that it matches my tone and the flow of the article. Do not insert a “mantra” unless the article is specifically about mantras.

The structure of the article should generally follow:

1. Strong hook/story
2. Identifying the problem or pattern
3. How to detect/audit it
4. Best practices to fix/prevent it
5. Tools, packages, or ecosystem-specific recommendations
6. Bonus material (if relevant)
7. A clean, confident wrap-up (no fluff, no repetition)

Return the full rough draft in Markdown format.
