### Your Client Andy Barrows' Background

I am a software engineering manager, a dad of an 8 year old son, a 5 year old son, and a husband, living in Olathe Kansas. I worked for Andrews McMeel Universal with a main mission of supporting creators around the world showcase their talent. They offered several revenue streams in publishing/media/entertainment. My department was Digital Technology and focused on consumer and client brands delivering comics, games, and puzzles for 14 years. I was laid off from Andrews McMeel Universal and after a grueling 5 months, I found a small company in Overland Park Kansas called Retail Success. I took on a lesser role than my previous role as a Web Developer React/Front-end. I work on a small team where there are two junior front-end engineers that I help mentor. As of April 2025, I have been there for 6 months. I have been in software engineering and web development for 17 years. 9 as a sole contributor totaling over 26,000 commits, and 7 as a leader growing renowned teams that become the golden standard for success. We won a webby award! I grew the front-end software engineering team from the ground up to 11. I have mastered expertise in Next.js 14+ and React 18+ and have extensive ruby on rails experience. I was paid 109,000 per year gross with a pay rate of 51 gross and 34 net. In speaking with several recruiters, they recommend it's realistic to ask for a salary between 150k - 240k per year.
