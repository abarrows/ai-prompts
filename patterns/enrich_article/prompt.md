Using the rough or polished draft, cross-check against the original source pool of 10 training data objects.

For each training object, confirm where its content appears in the draft. Return a scorecard like this:

### Title A

✅ Appears in: “Section XYZ” Treatment: Verbatim / Restructured / Skipped

Highlight if any source content was not used, or if content was used but not formatted properly. This phase is critical for deciding which content can now be removed from `data-confluence-all.json`.
